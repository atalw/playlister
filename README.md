# playlister (deprecated - being rebuilt)

All your youtube playlists on a single page

I primarily use youtube to listen to music and naturally, have created many playlists to sort my music.
I did not like the native UI for youtube playlists. Hence, I built playlister to list all of my playlists on a single page.

Used Youtube IFrame API and Data API.

## Script 
If you want to fetch the name of the current playing song, I wrote an [AppleScript](https://github.com/atalw/dotfiles/blob/master/applescripts/playlister.scpt) that does that. I use it with Tmux to display the song name in the bottom bar.

## Note
Make sure you have atleast one *public* playlist or a channel ID that does. 

## My playlists
**Channel ID**: UC_G8WIObcI0_zg0W00_60dA

## To-do

- Make it responsive
- Choose playlists
- Sort playlists functionality
- Make a mobile version (Maybe?)
