# playlister
All your youtube playlists on a single page

I primarily use youtube to listen to music and naturally, have created many playlists to sort my music.
I did not like the native UI for youtube playlists. Hence, I built playlister to list all of my playlists on a single page.

Used Youtube IFrame API and Data API.

## To-do

- Make it responsive
- Choose playlists
- Sort playlists functionality
- Make a mobile version (Maybe?)
